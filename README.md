# IGV-screenshooter

A simple script that takes an <interactive screenshot> of a given interval of a BAM.
Slice of the BAM is saved in the HTML file making it self-contained.

IGV.js is used for interactive visualization.
The igv.min.js file is taken from the [igv.js](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js) repo maintained by the [igvteam](https://github.com/igvteam).
